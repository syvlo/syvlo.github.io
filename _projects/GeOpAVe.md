## Description

Many foundation models working on geo-information data, in particular remote sensing images, are being developed. However, most of these models focus on a single modality. In this project, our objective is to jointly work on two complementing modalities: optical remote sensing images (e.g.  high-resolution orthophotos) and vector data (e.g. OpenStreetMap, OSM).

The GeOpAVe project is the result of a partnership with Google.
