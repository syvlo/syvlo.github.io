## Description

In a globalized context increasingly impacted by climate change, demographic studies would gain from taking environmental data into account and be carried out at the transnational level. However, this is not always possible in sub-Saharan Africa, as matching harmonized demographic and environ- mental data are seldom available. The large amount of data regularly acquired since 2015 (in 2019 only, Sentinel satellites from the European Space Agency produced 7.54 PiB of open-access data) provides an opportunity to produce relevant standardized indicators at the global scale. In this project, we aim at producing such indicators that can be matched to demographic surveys.

This project is the result of a partnership with <a href="https://www.ined.fr">INED</a> and is funded by the <a href="https://u-paris.fr/diip/">DiiP</a>.
