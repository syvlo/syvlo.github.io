I am an assistant professor (Maître de conférences) in Computer Science. I do research at the [SIP team](http://w3.mi.parisdescartes.fr/sip-lab/) of the [LIPADE](http://lipade.mi.parisdescartes.fr) laboratory and teach at <a href="https://math-info.u-paris.fr">UFR de Mathématiques et Informatique</a> in [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr). Before, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl) in the [Laboratory of Geo-information Science and Remote Sensing](https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Chair-groups/Environmental-Sciences/Laboratory-of-Geo-information-Science-and-Remote-Sensing.htm). I obtained my PhD in image processing from [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr) in 2017. This work was done in collaboration with [CNES](https://www.cnes.fr) and was awarded the [best PhD award from Fondation Mines-Télécom](https://www.fondation-mines-telecom.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CPPrixFondationMinesTelecom2018.pdf).

My research interests are in the areas of methodological developments in image processing with applications in particular to remote sensing imagery. This includes high-resolution optical images processing using deep learning techniques and change detection, classification and regularization on multi-temporal series of SAR images using Markov Random Fields models. During my PhD, I was working on the SWOT mission, dedicated to the study of the world’s oceans and its terrestrial surface waters. Since 2019, I also work on the interactions between remote sensing data and natural language. In particular, we introduced the task of Visual Question Answering for Remote Sensing ([RSVQA](https://rsvqa.sylvainlobry.com)).
