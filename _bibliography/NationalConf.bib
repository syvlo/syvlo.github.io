  abstract={Optical satellite images are commonly used to evaluate the snow cover. However, part of the information is lost due to clouds. 
To fill this gap we propose to detect the snow from Sentinel-1 SAR images using a convolutional neural network trained with labels obtained from MODIS optical images. A binary semantic segmentation is computed from two polarimetric SAR inputs: a wet snow ratio and a dry snow ratio.
The model, called SESAR U-net, is trained on a small area and then tested over a whole watershed. The missing labels are interpolated and the uncertainty due to clouds is considered. Our proposed method gives an overall accuracy higher than 80\%. },

  abstract={When dealing with high-dimensional multivariate time series classification problems, a well-known difficulty is the \textit{curse of dimensionality}. 
In this article, we propose an original approach of transposition of multidimensional data into images to tackle the task of classification. We propose a small hybrid model containing convolutional layers as a feature extractor followed by a recurrent neural network that take this transposed data as an input. We apply our method to a large dataset consisting of individual patient medical records. We show that our approach allows us to significantly reduce the size of a network and increase its performance by opting for a transformation of the input data.},

  title={Apprentissage profond pour la classification de QR Codes bruités},
  author={Leygonie, Rebecca and Lobry, Sylvain and Wendling, Laurent},
  booktitle={RFIAP/CAP 2022},
  year={2022},
  abstract={We wish to define the limitations of a classical classification model based on deep learning when applied on abstract images, which do not represent visually identifiable objects.
QR Codes fall into this category of abstract images: one bit corresponding to one encoded character, QR codes were not designed to be decoded by the naked eye. To understand the limitations of a deep learning-based model for abstract image classification, we train an image classification model on QR codes generated from the information obtained when reading a health pass. We compare the performance of a classification model with that of a classical (deterministic) decoding method in the presence of noise. This study allows us to conclude that a model based on deep learning can be relevant for the understanding of abstract images.},

  abstract={Simulation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is an essential component of SAR applications development. This can be done using style transfer methods or through physical simulators. We propose a hybrid approach : physical simulation of a SAR image from a material map ob- tained by a deep network taking the optical image as input. We compare the simulations with those from a style transfer method. The first results show the potential of our approach.},

  abstract={One of the objectives of the SWOT mission conducted by CNES and JPL is to obtain a global measurement of water heights. In order to apply an interferometric processing on SWOT images over continents, a first step is to obtain a classification indicating the presence of water. We introduce two methods adapted to the unusual acquisition parameters of the sensor for the detection of compact areas (i.e. lakes) and linear networks (i.e. rivers).},

The formula- ted decomposition model jointly estimates the background of the series and the scatterers. The decomposition mo- del retrieves possible changes in scatterers and the date at which they occurred. An exact optimization method of the model is presented and applied to a TerraSAR-X time series.},
